This is where I keep helpful resources from other researchers that have helped me to improve my coding skills

texdoc_output.do
This is a Stata dofile for Latex output from Magdalena Bennet
"If you are like me, and want to fully personalize everything in your LaTeX output, thereâ€™s nothing better than creating your own table in a dofile instead of using an out-of-the-can package. You can do it by using texdoc and writing your table from scratch using macros. Might sound like more work (it is), but it can also be pretty easy for getting that output just as you wanted. "
"(Credits due to @AndresGonzLira who showed me this command back in 2012 at JPAL LAC)."
